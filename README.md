# LLM-Chatbot-using-llama-3.2-3B-and-streamlit
A chatbot that uses the Llama 3.2-3B model to process the user prompt.

The description and the implementation are the same as in my previous Github repo: https://github.com/AkhilJx/LLM-Chatbot-using-llama-3.1-8B-and-streamlit . Instead of llama 3.1, select llamaa 3.2 in all the steps where the model is specified.
